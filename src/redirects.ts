/**
 * Legacy GitBook → new docs redirect rules.
 *
 * The three old GitBook domains are forwarded by Squarespace Domain
 * Forwarding (301, "Maintain paths"):
 *
 *   docs.ovenmediaengine.com/*            → ovenmedialabs.com/docs/ome/*
 *   docs.enterprise.ovenmediaengine.com/* → ovenmedialabs.com/docs/ome-enterprise/*
 *   docs.ovenplayer.com/*                 → ovenmedialabs.com/docs/ovenplayer/*
 *
 * Squarespace appends the original path verbatim, so GitBook's
 * version / locale / "guide" path segments survive the forward and
 * land on paths that don't exist on the new flat single-version site:
 *
 *   /docs/ome/0.18.0/configuration/x          (version prefix)
 *   /docs/ome-enterprise/guide/features/x     ("guide" space prefix)
 *   /docs/ome-enterprise/guide/ko-kr/x        (Korean locale, discontinued)
 *   /docs/ovenplayer/v0.9.x/x                 (version prefix)
 *
 * `createDocsRedirects` regenerates those legacy path variants for
 * every current route, so @docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects emits a
 * static stub that 301s each one to the live page. Policy (confirmed):
 * old versions and Korean both collapse onto the current English page.
 *
 * Sitemap analysis of all 922 indexed legacy URLs: 246 unique targets,
 * 243 covered by these rules; the remaining 3 are genuine renames /
 * removals handled explicitly in `explicitRedirects` below.
